I am Co-Guest Editor of a [Special Issue on Geographic Crime Analysis](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi/special_issues/Geographic_Crime_Analysis) in the open access [International Journal of Geo-Information](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi) (IF: 2.239).

Crime has an inherent geographic quality. For a crime to occur, it has to happen at some place, at some time. Analyzing the geography of crime is vital for developing our understanding of crime.

This Special Issue will provide contemporary research on geographic crime analysis. We are seeking contributions that advance existing techniques or introduces new techniques for better understanding the geography of crime. Papers should be original research manuscripts that meet with the [journal’s research articles requirements](https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijgi/about). Topics the Special Issue on Geographic Crime Analysis we anticipate will include are:

- Crime concentration and hot spot analysis
- Spatial-temporal analysis
- Repeat and near-repeat victimization
- Risky facilities
- Persistent, emerging and dispersed spatial patterns of crime
- Geographic offender profiling (for criminal investigations)
- Spatial regression analysis
- Mapping and analyzing risk (including forecasting and prediction)
- Crime harm mapping
- Impact evaluation techniques
- Simulation of crime patterns (and testing “what if“ scenarios)


Papers submitted for consideration must identify which of these topics the paper addresses by listing one (or more) of these topics in the key words associated with the manuscript.

The Special Issue is guest edited by Dr Spencer Chainey, Dr Matt Ashby, Dr Patricio Estévez-Soto, Ms. Sophie Curtis-Ham, and Mr. José Luis Hernandez.
