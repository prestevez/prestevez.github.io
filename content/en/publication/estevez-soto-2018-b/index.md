abstract: Objectives. Research consistently shows that crime concentrates on a few
  repeatedly victimized places and targets. In this paper we examine whether the same
  is true for extortion against businesses. We then test whether the factors that
  explain the likelihood of becoming a victim of extortion also explain the number
  of incidents suffered by victimized businesses. The alternative is that extortion
  concentration is a function of event dependence.  Methods. Drawing on Mexico’s commercial
  victimization survey, we determine whether repeat victimization occurs by chance
  by comparing the observed distribution to that expected under a Poisson process.
  Next, we utilize a multilevel negative binomial-logit hurdle model to examine whether
  area- and business-level predictors of victimization are also associated with the
  number of repeat extortions suffered by businesses.  Results. Findings suggest that
  extortion is highly concentrated, and that the predictors of repeated extortion
  differ from those that predict the likelihood of becoming a victim of extortion.
  While area-level variables showed a modest association with the likelihood of extortion
  victimization, they were not significant predictors of repeat incidents. Similarly,
  most business-level variables significantly associated with victimization risk showed
  insignificant (and sometimes contrary) associations with victimization concentration.
  Overall, unexplained differences in extortion concentration at the business-level
  were unaffected by predictors of extortion prevalence.  Conclusions. The inconsistent
  associations of predictors across the hurdle components suggest that extortion prevalence
  and concentration are fueled by two distinct processes, an interpretation congruent
  with theoretical expectations regarding extortion that considers that repeats are
  likely fueled by a process of event dependence.
