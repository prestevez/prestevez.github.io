abstract: >
    This article focuses on the situational-, victim-, and area-level determinants of extortion compliance. Extortion, a quintessential organised crime, is one of the most common crimes in Mexico. However, compliance with extortion demands is relatively rare. Previous research suggests that compliance with extortion depends on the perceived risk of punishment for non-compliance. However, most research has been theoretical or experimental. The article offers empirical evidence of patterns of extortion compliance based on data from a large commercial victimisation survey conducted in Mexico. Findings suggest that situational factors (extortion type, presence of weapons and number of offenders) are the main determinants of extortion compliance. Victim-, and area-level variables have comparatively smaller effects. Implications for research and practice are discussed.
