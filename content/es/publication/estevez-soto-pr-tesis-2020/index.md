abstract: "Research consistently shows that crime concentrates on a few repeatedly\
  \ victimised places and targets. However, such research has been mainly concerned\
  \ with 'traditional' crimes against individuals and households and has paid little\
  \ attention to the victimisation patterns of organised crimes. As such, it is not\
  \ clear whether organised crimes exhibit concentration patterns consistent with\
  \ repeat victimisation, nor whether the mechanisms that explain concentration in\
  \ 'traditional' crimes also explain the concentration of organised crimes. This\
  \ thesis is concerned with the victimisation patterns of extortion against businesses,\
  \ a quintessential organised crime activity. While the extortion phenomenon is often\
  \ understood as an institutionalised practice of extra-legal territorial control\
  \ exerted by organised criminal groups, this thesis approaches extortion predominantly\
  \ from a situational perspective, focusing on the incidents that constitute the\
  \ extortion phenomenon. Ultimately, the goal is to identify the incident-, victim-,\
  \ and area-level characteristics that affect the patterns of extortion victimisation.\
  \ To achieve this, it relies on secondary analysis of Mexico's National Commercial\
  \ Victimisation Survey 2014, one of the largest business victimisation surveys in\
  \ the world. The thesis uses quantitative modelling to answer four research questions:\
  \ is extortion concentrated beyond what is expected by chance? What could explain\
  \ repeat extortion victimisation patterns? What are the predictors of compliance\
  \ with extortion demands? And, do patterns and mechanisms of repeat victimisation\
  \ vary according to the type of extortion suffered? The findings suggest that incident-,\
  \ and victim-level measures are more relevant than area-level characteristics to\
  \ understand extortion victimisation patterns. Furthermore, the findings suggest\
  \ that event dependence is a stronger predictor of extortion concentration than\
  \ risk heterogeneity. Lastly, the thesis discusses the implications of the findings\
  \ for academia, crime statistics, and crime prevention policy."
