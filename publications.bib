abstract = {Research consistently shows that crime concentrates on a few repeatedly victimised places and targets. However, such research has been mainly concerned with 'traditional' crimes against individuals and households and has paid little attention to the victimisation patterns of organised crimes. As such, it is not clear whether organised crimes exhibit concentration patterns consistent with repeat victimisation, nor whether the mechanisms that explain concentration in 'traditional' crimes also explain the concentration of organised crimes. This thesis is concerned with the victimisation patterns of extortion against businesses, a quintessential organised crime activity. While the extortion phenomenon is often understood as an institutionalised practice of extra-legal territorial control exerted by organised criminal groups, this thesis approaches extortion predominantly from a situational perspective, focusing on the incidents that constitute the extortion phenomenon. Ultimately, the goal is to identify the incident-, victim-, and area-level characteristics that affect the patterns of extortion victimisation. To achieve this, it relies on secondary analysis of Mexico's National Commercial Victimisation Survey 2014, one of the largest business victimisation surveys in the world. The thesis uses quantitative modelling to answer four research questions: is extortion concentrated beyond what is expected by chance? What could explain repeat extortion victimisation patterns? What are the predictors of compliance with extortion demands? And, do patterns and mechanisms of repeat victimisation vary according to the type of extortion suffered? The findings suggest that incident-, and victim-level measures are more relevant than area-level characteristics to understand extortion victimisation patterns. Furthermore, the findings suggest that event dependence is a stronger predictor of extortion concentration than risk heterogeneity. Lastly, the thesis discusses the implications of the findings for academia, crime statistics, and crime prevention policy.},

abstract = {Research on repeat victimisation consistently reveals that crimes to concentrate within a small subset of victims. Given a recent increase on the number of extortions against businesses in Mexico, this research aimed to answer whether extortion concentrates within a small subset of businesses and if so, what could explain this concentration. Drawing from a national commercial victimisation survey conducted in 2013, several hypothesis relating to potential sources of risk heterogeneity were tested using single and multilevel modelling based on the negative binomial regression. Results showed that extortion concentrates far beyond what can be explained by chance, and that extortion incidence is positively associated with corruption incidents, years in business, state homicide rates, and being a restaurant, hotel or bar. Alternatively, it was found that the smallest businesses suffer less extortion than larger businesses. State level effects were found to be comparatively small to differences between businessses. Implications for research and crime policy in Mexico are briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Objectives.
Research consistently shows that crime concentrates on a few repeatedly victimized places and targets. In this paper we examine whether the same is true for extortion against businesses. We then test whether the factors that explain the likelihood of becoming a victim of extortion also explain the number of incidents suffered by victimized businesses. The alternative is that extortion concentration is a function of event dependence.

Methods.
Drawing on Mexicoâ€™s commercial victimization survey, we determine whether repeat victimization occurs by chance by comparing the observed distribution to that expected under a Poisson process. Next, we utilize a multilevel negative binomial-logit hurdle model to examine whether area- and business-level predictors of victimization are also associated with the number of repeat extortions suffered by businesses.

Results.
Findings suggest that extortion is highly concentrated, and that the predictors of repeated extortion differ from those that predict the likelihood of becoming a victim of extortion. While area-level variables showed a modest association with the likelihood of extortion victimization, they were not significant predictors of repeat incidents. Similarly, most business-level variables significantly associated with victimization risk showed insignificant (and sometimes contrary) associations with victimization concentration. Overall, unexplained differences in extortion concentration at the business-level were unaffected by predictors of extortion prevalence.

Conclusions.
The inconsistent associations of predictors across the hurdle components suggest that extortion prevalence and concentration are fueled by two distinct processes, an interpretation congruent with theoretical expectations regarding extortion that considers that repeats are likely fueled by a process of event dependence.},
